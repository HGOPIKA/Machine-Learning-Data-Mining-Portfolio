A comprehensive collection of machine learning implementations covering Supervised Learning (Classification &amp; Regression) and Unsupervised Learning (Clustering &amp; Association Rules).

# Applied Machine Learning & Data Mining Portfolio

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a series of end-to-end Machine Learning projects designed to solve real-world problems in Healthcare, Finance, and Retail. It demonstrates proficiency in Python-based modeling, statistical evaluation, and data-driven storytelling.

## 🛠️ Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)
1. **Fetal Health Prediction (Healthcare):** Classified CTG data into 3 health statuses using **Random Forest** (93.4% accuracy) and **KNN**.
2. **Gender Identification (Facial Analytics):** Built a classification model using facial measurements, achieving **96.6% accuracy**.
3. **Automotive Pricing Engine (Finance):** Developed a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict car prices based on technical specifications (R-squared analysis).
4. **Sales Forecasting:** Simple Linear Regression to correlate ambient temperature with daily retail revenue.

## 📈 Unsupervised Learning (Clustering & Association)
1. **Customer Segmentation (Marketing):** Used **K-Means (Elbow Method)** and **DBSCAN** to segment mall customers based on income and spending scores (Silhouette score analysis).
2. **Market Basket Analysis (Retail):** Implemented the **FP-Growth algorithm** to discover frequent itemsets and association rules in transactional data to optimize inventory and cross-selling.

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **ML Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, MLxtend (FP-Growth)
- **Techniques:** EDA, Standardisation, Label Encoding, Confusion Matrix, Silhouette Analysis.
